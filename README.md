## Oscar Winners Gender Analysis
For this project, I gathered data on film scripts by using Beautifulsoup to scrape them from the web.
I then manually used markup to tag when male and female actors/characters spoke.
Using these tags, I counted and compared the number of times men and women spoke to get an insight into any inequalities in Oscar winning films.
