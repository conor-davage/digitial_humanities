That was what was so troubling about it. - The thought that I suddenly did. - No. Sarah, you must say hello to the little ones.\\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker>\\nNo. It is macabre. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nPlease. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nNo. I love you, but that I will not do. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nIf you love me... - Love has limits. It should not. [KEYS JINGLING] \\n[LOCK TURNING] You do not lisp, but you are mad. Giving me a palace? \\nI\\'ve been wanting to give you something for quite some time now. \\nSeemed like the perfect opportunity with Marlborough winning. \\nIt is a monstrous extravagance, Mrs. Morley. We are at war. We won. \\nIt is not over. We must continue. Oh. Oh, I did not know that. \\n[CROW CAWING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [FOOTSTEPS] \\n\\n<speaker>WOMAN</speaker> \\nTake a hunk of bread.

Go through here. Clean yourself up. Thank you so much. - \\n[BILLIARDS BALLS CLACKING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Lady Marlborough. \\nI didn\\'t know the new sewer ended in here. It is I, Abigail. \\nDear cousin. I have a letter from our aunt... and... I\\'m sorry,\\nI did not mean to present as a... I fell out of a carriage. \\n[SHRIEKS] And a man was pulling his... Never mind the man. \\nThe letter from our aunt. [FLIES BUZZING] Friends of yours? I\\'m sorry.\\nYour name, girl. If we are blood, name it. - I did not? Abigail Hill. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nThe Somerset Hills? The one who went mad and burnt his own house down, \\nhimself in it? Lost all his money at whist. No one bets on whist. \\nMy uncle was one of a kind. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI apologize for my appearance. The staff led me here. \\nA harmless prank of some sort, I suspect. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nAnd you want... I hoped I might be employed here by you... \\nas something. A monster for the children to play with, perhaps?\\nYes, if you like. [GROWLS] [CHUCKLES] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] \\n[BELL RINGS] [MUFFLED CHEERING] [CHEERING CONTINUES] [CHEERING STOPS]\\n[MUSIC FADES] A palace. You seem angry at my good fortune and\\nI thought we were friends. I really doubt you\\'ve made that mistake. \\nI was actually just teasing. I thought you\\'d see that. It will not stand.\\nWell, it will if I build it using the finest craftsmen in the land. \\nI hope it will stand for 100 years as a symbol of my husband\\'s gallant victory.\\nListen, I applaud your husband\\'s gallant victory, but considering the parlous\\nstate of the treasury, it seems something the queen should\\'ve taken advice \\nfrom her loyal opposition on. Oh, but then it would\\'ve lost its delightful\\nsurprise element. Cunt! \\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nHoratio has done it again. Prime Minister,\\nwe need to discuss who will go to the French with the peace treaty proposal.\\nWe do not need a peace treaty proposal. We have them on the run. So they\\nwill give in to us. One battle will not win the war. \\nI have held my party together, as we the country landowners have \\nessentially paid for this entire war... And grateful we are, too. ..\\n.while city merchants enrich themselves from it. And yet I do not see\\nyour fat tweedy dead when I look out upon the battlefield. We\\'re out of money.\\nMy point. The French are chastened, but not defeated, Harley. We must destroy\\nthem. Make them sue for peace with broken hearts and begging backs. - \\nHow sweet your wife is, Marlborough. - Sweet and right. I cannot agree.\\nWe must take it to the queen. If you\\'d be kind enough to arrange a time,\\nLady Marlborough. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nOf course. [SNORING] [WOMAN COUGHS] [EXCLAIMS] I\\'m ready for the Russian \\nambassador. Who did your makeup? We went for something dramatic. Do you like it?\\nYou look like a badger. Oh. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nAre you going to cry? Really? Well, what do you think you look like? \\nA badger. Do you really think you can meet the Russian delegation looking\\nlike that? No. I will manage it. Get back to your rooms. Thank you. \\nDid you just look at me? Did you? Look at me! Look at me! How dare you?\\nClose your eyes! \\n\\n<speaker>SALLY</speaker> \\nHello. Hello. Mrs. Meg says you are to scrub the floor until she can see \\nher toothless, fat face in it. Sorry. [GASPS] You might need gloves. \\nLye is dangerous. It burns bad.

Ow! \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nGently. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nI can\\'t. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYes, you can. Cousin, start wrapping. Everyone else, leave please. \\n[WHIMPERING] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nHow we first met. Tell me that. The wretched Cheever boy had me on the \\nground and he was holding me and dropping spittle in my face. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nHe is still a pig. Then what? [ANNE SNIFFLING] \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nAnd then I heard footsteps. Fast footsteps. Ow, ow! [BIRDS CHIRPING] \\nAnd I saw these pink shoes running towards me. And then they disappeared. \\nAnd then I heard a crack. And then he fell off me. [ANNE MOANS] And you\\nheld my hand and said, \"Hello. I\\'m Sarah. You\\'re covered in spittle. \\nLet\\'s wash you off.\" [ANNE SCREAMS] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nDo you remember how his jaw just hung there? \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\n[LAUGHS] I do. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou must try to sleep. - [ANNE MOANS] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou may go. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nDon\\'t leave me! - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nI won\\'t. - Are you still there? - Yes. - Are you still there? -\\nYes. [MUFFLED CHATTER] \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nFor the queen. The doctor\\'s ordered it immediately. It\\'s a matter of \\nextreme urgency. She\\'s sleeping. Shall I tell the doctor you imperiled \\nthe queen\\'s health and let you rue the ramifications? What does \"ramific...\"\\nIt means he will have you whipped. [DOOR OPENS] What are you doing? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nThis is peleatis, the herb. I cut some this morning. It reduces swelling and\\ninflammation. I thought it may help the queen. You cannot just walk in here.\\nWhy did the footman let you through? It\\'s not his fault. I lied to him. FOOT\\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nThe prime minister and Mr. Marlborough. I just wanted to help her. \\nShe seemed to suffer so much. Footman. Take her downstairs. Tell Mrs. Meg \\nshe is to receive six of the birch. Go. It\\'s peleatis, the herb. Anne, you\\nmust focus. \\n\\n<speaker>MARLBOROUGH</speaker> \\nWe gather our forces here. The Austrians mass here. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nWhich country is that again? \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nListen. Marlborough. \\n\\n<speaker>MARLBOROUGH</speaker> \\nThis is the town of Lille, in a valley in France. We lure them in by sending \\na small force to engage them. They give chase. We descend in numbers from \\nabove. - \\n\\n<speaker>ALL</speaker>\\nHear, hear! - Hear, hear! It is an excellent plan. Queen Anne,\\ndo you agree? The people expect it to be over. Well, we all want it \\nto be over, but wishing does not make it so. We could sue for peace,\\nbut we will not get it. It does help. - What? - There\\'s something\\nsoothing on my legs, it takes the burn out. What is it? Oh, herbs,\\nof some sort. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nPlease, please. What is going on? Do her in the barn, if that\\'s what it is, \\nnot in my kitchen. Her Ladyship says six of the birch for this one. \\n[ABIGAIL WHIMPERS] [SCREAMS] [CRIES] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nStop. Let her go. Come with me. [PANTING] So, you are perhaps too kind for \\nyour own good. It has been said. Which leads to stupidity. The queen is\\nsoothed somewhat, so I thank you. You will get me some more of those herbs\\nand not overstep again. My father always spoke highly of you. I liked your\\nfather. He had charm to burn. Then I guess he did. You have fallen far. \\nWhen I was 15, my father lost me in a card game. You are not serious. \\nThis one here. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nHe was very upset about it. Took off into the forest with nothing but a \\nscullery maid and a dozen bottles for solace. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nAnd you went? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI wanted to do right by my father. The debt was to a balloon-shaped German\\nman with a thin cock. Thankfully, I managed to convince him a woman has her\\nblood in 28 days a month. [CHUCKLES QUIETLY] What happened to your hand? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nSome of my... colleagues are immune to my charms. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]\\nEarl Stratford, do not come near me whining today or I will crush your \\ntiny heart to liver. Madame Tournee. You may have the tapestry budget you \\nasked for. Spend one penny more and I will take your fingernails in lieu.\\n\\n<speaker>TOURNEE</speaker> \\nMerci. Abigail, get a platter of oysters sent to the Dutch ambassador. \\nYes, Your Ladyship. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nColonel Masham. Lady Marlborough. The queen will ride on Wednesday. \\nYes, Lady Marlborough. Would you like a bite of my new maid before you leave?\\n[MUSIC FADES] [DUCK QUACKS] Must the duck be here? Fastest duck in the city. \\nHoratio is a prize worth stealing. He does not leave my side. Keep him away\\nfrom me, or I will pull his liver out and eat it with a cornichon. \\nCharming. You should know I\\'ve canvassed my party. They\\'re waiting for \\nus to announce an attempt at peace. We shall both make our case to the queen.\\nYes, where is the queen? We\\'ve been waiting an hour. - FOOT\\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nLady Sarah Marlborough. - I\\'m here. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nMight I remind you you\\'re not the queen? No, she has sent me to speak for her.\\nShe is unwell. \\n\\n<speaker>PRIME MINISTER</speaker> \\nWhat says she? That Harley is a fop and a prat and smells like a 96-year-old \\nFrench whore\\'s vajuju. Oh? Well, I really doubt you\\'re quoting. \\nShe has decided to continue with the war. She feels another victory in will \\nput us in a stronger position for a treaty. Her letters. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nAnd how are we going to pay for this? The land tax is to be doubled. \\nThis is madness. The war you will be fighting will be in our own countryside. \\nShe relies on you and your love of England to hold the Tories together. - \\nThere are limits. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nThe love of your country? To me, there is no limit on that. \\nOur last farthing to protect England if we must. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nAnd our last man, too? Look, the dead pile up, as do the resentments. - \\nOr that does not concern you? - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nI grieve them all. In my heart, a scar for each, and I send my own beloved \\nwith them, chest bared. So do not lecture me on the cost. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nA treaty would save money and lives. A win for all Englishmen. \\n\\n<speaker>PRIME MINISTER</speaker> \\nWe go to them after one victory, they know we are scared. We bury more of them,\\nthey know we have them. The queen has decided, Harley. I disagree. A lot. \\nI\\'d like an audience with the queen where I may state my case. State it to me. \\nI love a comedy. Is there cake? \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nThis is a disgusting distortion of the system. You have no place in this.\\nYour mascara is running. If you\\'d like to go fix yourself, we can continue\\nthis later. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou will need to pay for the repair of that. We have a war to finance. \\nEvery penny counts. \\n\\n<speaker>PRIME MINISTER</speaker> \\nCome on, old bean. One more victory. [DUCK QUACKS] \\n\\n<speaker>PRIME MINISTER</speaker> \\nMust you rub it in? A man\\'s dignity is the one thing that holds him back \\nfrom running amok. Sometimes a lady likes to have some fun. \\n\\n<speaker>PRIME MINISTER</speaker> \\nWe need to be careful, Sarah. He\\'s a useful ally, but a dangerous enemy. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nBorrow anything you want. Thank you. And thank you for the job. \\nI have a thing for the weak. FOOT\\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nLord Marlborough. \\n\\n<speaker>MARLBOROUGH</speaker> \\nIt is time. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou must be safe. You must not be foolish and brave. Be smart and safe, \\nI beg you. I will. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nStay with me tonight. \\n\\n<speaker>MARLBOROUGH</speaker> \\nI must sleep with my men. It is only right. I had a dream that this very \\nsmall Frenchman covered in blood... was carrying Marlborough\\'s head around,\\nfeeding it Brie. He\\'s a great soldier. He will be fine. - We will prevail.\\n- Of course we will, Mrs. Freeman. [CHUCKLES] [COUGHS] \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI\\'m sorry, Your Majesty. I think I caught a chill picking the herbs for \\nyour leg. - \\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nThat was you? - Abigail. Let\\'s shoot something. - [GUNSHOT] - [BIRD CAWS] \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nIt\\'s sad really. They\\'re so pretty. Throw. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou\\'re really doing damage to the sky. Can I ask you something? \\nAs long as you are aware that I have a gun. You fought hard for this\\nwar and your husband is at the front of it. His life is at risk. - \\nHow can you do that? - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nIt is right. If we don\\'t do it, they will gather force and be over here \\ncutting us all into chops within the year. You are of a sweet disposition\\nand have suffered blows, so desire safety and favor above all else. If he\\ndies? \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nDid you not sacrifice your cunt to fatty German to save your father? - Yes. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nThere\\'s always a price to pay. I am prepared to pay it. - Throw. -\\n[WINGS FLAPPING] [GUNSHOT] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> Just relax and aim. When it crosses your eye, pull\\nthe trigger. Throw. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nPerfect. I will make a killer of you yet. \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nAre you following me? I said, are you following me? \\nYou seem to be following me, sir, as I am in front of you. \\nThat was you I saw on the horse that morning. I am a servant. \\nWhere would I get a horse? Perhaps you dreamt of me? Perhaps it was you,\\nand I should have you stripped and whipped. I\\'m waiting. Going to ride that\\none, are we? She does make my blood hot. She\\'s Lady Marlborough\\'s new one.\\nIndeed. Interesting. [FOOTSTEPS] \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nExcuse me. Move. Excuse me. - Your Majesty. How lovely to see you. - \\n[FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] It seems you have allocated even more money into\\nthe abyss that is this fool\\'s errand. Oh, uh, yes. We will win. Sarah\\'s\\nsure we will win. It\\'s the landholders\\' tax. You have no idea the firestorm\\nof rage you have set loose in the countryside. - Really? Are they angry? \\n- Dearest queen. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nHow do you like my stockings? \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nFestive. Very. I was just explaining to the queen the mistake this tax is.\\nThe war as well. We should sue for peace. Oh, Harley, you are such a bore.\\nThat is for parliament. A ball is for dancing and eating those horseradish \\nand venison puffs. Have you tried them? I\\'m having trouble swallowing at \\nthe moment. Your Majesty... I\\'d like to enjoy the music now. Oh, yes.\\nI love this music. I must dance. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES]\\n[MUSIC CONTINUES] Stop it! - Stop it! Stop! - [MUSIC STOPS] - \\nWhat has happened? - I would like to go back to my room now. Stop. Mr. Harley. \\nI agree I went too far with the tax for the war. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWhat? - It will stay as it was. We are your servants, my queen. Anne.\\nI\\'m sorry. It\\'s okay. Shall we go fast? - [ANNE CHEERS] - [SARAH GIGGLES] \\n[ANNE CHEERING, DISTANT] - [CHEERING GETS CLOSER] - [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] \\n[ANNE AND SARAH LAUGH] [BOTH GIGGLE] [ANNE PANTING] Fuck me. - \\n[KISSING] - [PANTING] Abigail, isn\\'t it? Yes, sir. Stolen a book, I see.\\nWhy, one could be stripped and whipped for that. My mistress lent it to me. \\nShall we go ask her? - No. - [MUFFLED LAUGHTER] No.\\nCome and take the night air with me. So, you once were a lady, and now you \\nare nothing. A bit of scullery scraps. How very sad. Well, I\\'m still the lady\\nI was, in my heart. No doubt. It is important to make new friends, is it not?\\nYes. If that\\'s what\\'s actually happening here, and not veiled threats under\\nthe guise of civility. Am I to understand you are smart? You want something.\\nTo fuck me? I will leave that to my friend Masham, who is completely\\ncunt-struck by you. So, tell me about Lady Marlborough, Godolphin, the queen.\\nAnything going on? I love gossip. It\\'s a failing, I know. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\n[SIGHS] Lady Marlborough has been good to me. She saved me. I will not breach\\nher confidence. Of course. You are in favor. But favor is a breeze that \\nshifts direction all the time. Then in an instant, you\\'re back sleeping with\\na bunch of scabrous whores wondering whose finger\\'s in your ass. You cannot \\nhave too many friends in court. I need a friend, Abigail. One with cute ears\\nand wide eyes. I\\'m often blindsided by the distorted situation at court. As \\nleader of the opposition, I should not be. I would merely like to know of any\\nplans Her Ladyship, Godolphin, or the queen may have. I will not betray my\\nmistress\\'s trust. Oh, look. A wren. How cute. [GRUNTS] You all right? \\n[PANTING] Anyway, think on it. There\\'s no pressure. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou will have to tell Harley you\\'ve changed your mind about the tax. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nAre the people really angry about the land tax? \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nThey\\'ll be angrier when the French are sodomizing their wives and planting\\ntheir fields with garlic. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> The Tories must not be rode roughshod over,\\nthough. And more dead if we do it. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nIt is painful to lose men, but we cannot be halfhearted in this or they will\\nsee our weakness and take us and we will lose thousands more. None for the\\nqueen. What? You cannot have hot chocolate. Your stomach, the sugar inflames it.\\n- Abigail, hand me that cup. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nDo not. I\\'m sorry, I do not know what to do. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nFine, give it to her. Then you can get a bucket and a mop for the aftermath. \\nTake me back. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] You will pronounce the tax in \\nparliament. I will set the date. [MUSIC FADES] \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI must tell you something. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nGo on. Mr. Harley came to me and asked me to betray your confidence about \\nwhat goes on between you and the queen and Godolphin. I see. And what will\\nyou do? I\\'m not going to, obviously. Not obviously. \\nYou may tell me of his approach to encourage my trust and still \\nwork both sides of the street. I am a person of honor, even if my \\nstation is not. Even if I were the last one left in this wretched place,\\nI would remain a lady. [LAUGHS] You\\'re pretty when outraged.\\nSo my secrets are safe with you? All of them. Good. Even your biggest secret.\\nAbigail. [GASPS] If you forget to load the pellet, the gun fires, \\nmakes the sound, but releases no shot. It is a great jape. Do you agree? \\nYes. Maybe we will think of a use for it one day. Sometimes, it is hard to\\nremember whether you have loaded the pellet or not. I do fear confusion \\nand accidents. I\\'m sure people will be careful. [GAGGING] [BREATHES DEEPLY]\\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nBeef, 12 guineas. Cream. Mrs. Meg, your cream bill is outrageous. \\nAre you bathing in it to help your hemorrhoids? No, Your Ladyship. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nMay I examine? Of course. It\\'s perfect, Lady Marlborough, as always. \\n\\n<speaker>PAGE</speaker> \\n[WHISPERING] The queen. It is rather urgent. Shall we sign off? Of course.\\n[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Aim for the flagstones. The lawn might break your \\nfall. You do not care. Mrs. Morley. - Please! - No! [CRIES] [MUSIC FADES] \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nStay a while. No! Take the day off. I command it. Someone must run things. \\nI am not food. You cannot just eat and eat. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nYet you are tasty and salty. [SQUEALS] If I grilled you, you\\'d make a\\ndelightful meal. Very well. I will come and see you this afternoon, \\nand we can play whist. [FOOTSTEPS] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nThe opposition asks us - to be halfhearted in this war! - \\n[LOUD, INDISTINCT CHATTER] - We will not! - \\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nHear, hear! We must wear our griefs, for England is worth our all, \\nand suffer we must for her! Mr. Harley, control your rabble! I am, \\ntherefore, announcing today - that, at Her Majesty\\'s... - [MUSIC FADES] \\nAbout time, Mrs. Freeman. This fucking leg. It\\'s like a monster attacking me.\\nCut it off for me, will you? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI don\\'t think so, Your Majesty. Why are you here? Lady Marlborough sent me,\\nas I am an excellent whist player and she has been unavoidably detained with\\nbusiness of state, but will be here posthaste. It\\'s my state. I am the\\nbusiness of state. Did she actually send me her maid? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYour Majesty, I wasn\\'t always a maid. I\\'m educated, I speak Latin, French.\\nMy family fell on hard times. - I\\'m also her cousin. - It\\'s all very \\nfascinating. You shall leave, regardless, and tell her to come. They\\'re \\ngorgeous. They\\'re my babies. Let them out, please. How many are there? \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nSeventeen. It\\'s Hildebrand\\'s day today. Which one is he? \\nThat one there. Shy, but stubborn. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nMay I? \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nHe likes you. I lost some 17 children. Some were born as blood, \\nsome without breath... and some were with me for a very brief time. \\nOh, my dear. Today is Hildebrand\\'s day. The day you lost him. Yes.\\nEach one that dies, a little bit of you goes with them. Would you \\nlike to join me? \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nOh. Lovely cake. Yum. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYou like it? - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nDelish. - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYou do like it. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nHello, Sussy. Happy birthday. Come on. There\\'s some for you, too. \\nDon\\'t eat Mummy\\'s foot. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] What an outfit. Thank you.\\nI thought it might be too much. Have you come to seduce me or rape me? \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nI am a gentleman. So rape, then. No. No, you are... You have intrigued me.\\nAnd you, me. I\\'m intrigued by what you look like under all this. \\nYou\\'re handsome. No wonder you cover it up. Who are you? No ordinary maid.\\nIt could be said I have fallen far. It could be said I aim to catch you. Ow!\\nI might allow it. Now good night, sir. Progress? Uh... She, uh... - \\nShe bit me. - Oh. This wig\\'s ridiculous. A man must look pretty. \\nI\\'m not entirely sure she approves. Try again in your own way, old boy.\\n[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC FADES] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nApologies regarding sending Abigail in my stead. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nShe was perfectly darling. Hildebrand really took to her. Is that a rabbit?\\nAnne, you are too sensitive. And you are too mean and uncaring, some days.\\nSome days, I\\'m quite lovely, though. Let\\'s think on them. Anne. You\\'re such\\na child. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI guess all the rapes were the hardest. Made me feel at their mercy.\\nThat I was nothing. You are not nothing. You\\'re a dear person. Thank you.\\nYou\\'re so beautiful. Stop it. You mock me. I do not. If I were a man,\\nI would ravish you. - Ravish. - Enough. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. \\n[MUSIC PLAYING, DISTANT] Oh, look. [CHILDREN PLAYING MUSIC] \\nMake them stop. What? Stop! Enough! Stop! Be gone! I command it! Leave! \\nI don\\'t want to hear it! - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYour Majesty? - Now I must rest. - Shall I... - Leave me be! \\n[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Give me that.

[ANNE LAUGHS] [GUNSHOT] [WINGS FLAPPING] - \\n[GUN COCKS] - [WINGS FLAPPING] [GUNSHOT] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nIt\\'s 12-11. You\\'re shooting exceptionally well, Abigail. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYou\\'ve taught me well. I hope you haven\\'t found your time with the queen\\ntoo tedious. Oh, not at all. And if it gives you rest, I\\'m happy. -\\nDid you sleep well? - Like a shot badger. Excellent. The queen is... \\nan extraordinary person... even if it\\'s not readily apparent. She\\'s been\\nstalked by tragedy. She seems quite lovely. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nI will not burden you again. - I\\'m quite happy to... - I know you are.\\nShe will be angry if I do not appear soon. Take your shot. Throw. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nThirteen. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nThe queen? I will be there directly. The queen... asked for her. \\nI have sent for some lobsters. I thought we could race them and then eat them.\\n- Oh, hello. - Oh, hello. I hope you have three. You sent for Abigail to try \\nand make me jealous, I think. Perhaps. [GASPS] They\\'ll be in with the lobsters.\\nYou scared? [DOOR OPENS] Oh, I think a moat is a bad idea. It\\'s just... \\nIt\\'s too old-fashioned. Your lobsters, ma\\'am. Where should I put them? Uh...\\nhere. [EXCLAIMS] Hello. Remember me? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nMr. Harley. You always unbalance me. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nSo what\\'s been happening? The queen and Lady Marlborough are to race \\nlobsters and then eat them. Do you want to get punched? The queen\\'s going\\nto announce the doubling of the landholders\\' tax to parliament. Do you jest?\\nI don\\'t think she\\'s certain of it, though. But Lady Marlborough is providing\\nthat certainty. Yes. And? That is all. Why do I feel that is not all? \\nI\\'m trying my best. I am. All right, turn off the tears. Thank you. \\nHave a pleasant evening. May I speak a moment, with Her Majesty\\'s pleasure?\\nMay I exhort the chamber to roar a mighty hurrah for Her Majesty in her \\nbrilliant decision to not raise the land tax. - CROWD: Hurrah! - \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nFor the doubling of the tax would have been a disaster, and the fields would\\nhave run with blood as the countryside rose up against our city friends, to\\nadd to the piling dead of our sons already on the field of this war. Again,\\nto our queen, for her deep wisdom in knowing where to draw the line in holding\\nour country together. For there is no point winning a war abroad if we are to\\nstart one at home. - CROWD: Hear, hear! - CROWD: Hurrah! \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nI apologize for the interruption, Your Majesty. \\nThe floor is yours, of course. We look forward to hearing what you have to say.\\n[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [IMITATION ANIMAL SOUND] [CLICKING] - [SCREAMS] - \\n[SCREAMS] Men should not sneak up on women. You look scared. \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nI\\'m hurt. [ABIGAIL SHRIEKS] - [MASHAM GRUNTS] - [ABIGAIL SHRIEKS] \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nWait, wait! Kiss me properly first. - [MASHAM GRUNTS] - [ABIGAIL GIGGLES] \\nI have just now decided to marry you, Masham. I cannot marry a servant. \\nI can enjoy one, though. I know it would ruin you to marry me. I will fix\\nthings for us. Don\\'t you think we are a good match? I think a very good match.\\n[MASHAM SCREAMS] I looked like a fool. They were all staring, weren\\'t they? \\nI can tell even if I can\\'t see, and I heard the word \"fat.\" Fat. - And ugly. \\n- Anne. No one but me would dare, and I did not. I felt for you. He set you up.\\nIt is our fault. I didn\\'t know what else to do. I couldn\\'t go through with it. \\nIt\\'s fine, Anne. It\\'s fine. He was ready for us. He probably just assumed that\\nyou\\'ve been working on her. A minor hitch. We will reset the date. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nWhat are you doing? Oh, Your Majesty. Lady Marlborough asked me to wait for \\nyou, and I was... The bed looked so beautiful, and I was overcome... \\nwith foolishness. I\\'m sorry. Well, you may get out now. Apologies again, \\nYour Majesty. What happened to your dress? Wolves. Her legs. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nRub my legs. Does it hurt a lot? They\\'re agony. [MOANS PLEASURABLY] \\nOh, the pain. Marlborough has written. He\\'s in position. The battle will\\nbegin any time. He will prevail. Of course. I imagine you will not sleep\\ntonight. I can stay and sit with you. I\\'m all right. Good morning, \\nLady Marlborough. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nDid you see that book of poetry from the Dryden fellow? I... have not. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nNo. No. No. No. No. I don\\'t understand. Did you take it? My book. - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nNo. - I think you are a pretty little liar that I have misjudged.\\nI did not mean for this to happen. The queen, she\\'s forceful. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou are dismissed from my service. Go back to Mrs. Meg and tell her to \\nfind you a position in the scullery. And if she asks why, tell her \\n\"Because I am a disloyal little bitch.\" Yes, Your Ladyship. It has been\\nan honor and privilege... If you do not go, I will start kicking you and\\nI will not stop. [PANTING] [MUFFLED CRYING] [CRYING CONTINUES] [SNIFFLING]\\n- You have become close to Abigail. - She\\'s been a dear. Yes. It is such\\na shame, but I\\'ve had to dismiss her for theft. She\\'s a liar and a thief.\\nYour tongue seems uncharacteristically still. I heard you. She\\'s my servant.\\nShe\\'s not dismissed. I\\'ve made her my maid of the bedchamber. \\nDid you not hear what I said? Yes, you regard her as a liar and a thief. \\n- Yes. - I do not, obviously. You will dismiss her. I don\\'t want to. I like\\nit when she puts her tongue inside me. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES]\\nIt feels so strange to be in this. It\\'s good for you. The doctor says it\\'ll \\nleach the toxins. What if I should fall asleep and slip under? Just imagine \\nit\\'s hot chocolate. - Oh, then I shall die happy. - [ABIGAIL GIGGLES] \\n[DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nAfter you left, I thought, \"What a grand idea to take to the mud.\" \\nTo get whatever poisons one carries with one out. [MUD SLOSHING] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nAbigail, could you fetch me some refreshment? I would like to, of course, \\nbut... I must be at the queen\\'s side and behest at all times. It is my role.\\nSuch loyalty. How delightful it is when one tries to cultivate a new trait \\nin one\\'s character. - Do not scratch at her. - [SARAH SCOFFS] Mr. Freeman. \\nMr. Morley. Oh, how handsome you are. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nHow handsome you are, Mr. Freeman. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nOh... But I... I forgot my glasses. [ANNE AND SARAH LAUGH] [CHUCKLES] \\nYou will be back in the street. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nDo you remember when we were young, and we were not allowed out in the snow,\\nand we opened all the windows in the ballroom and sat there as the snow \\nflurries just wafted in? And when your governess came in, we were making a \\nsnowman and our hands were blue. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nOh, it was such fun. - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nSounds marvelous. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nSo many things we have done together. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI do love ancient history. Sorry, Abigail, did you say something? \\nOh, I was singing. I cannot get a tune out of my head. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWell, there is so much room for it. [ABIGAIL CHUCKLES] Lady Marlborough,\\nyou\\'re such a wit. Oh, Abigail, you are a dear. I think I shall retire for \\nthe evening. Shall I prepare your bed, Queen Anne? Or shall you and I adjourn\\nto your apartments for some sherry? \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nOh! Sherry sounds just the ticket. - Good night, Abigail. - \\nYes, good night, dear Abigail. You are enjoying all of this, aren\\'t you?\\nTo be beloved? Of course. To see you trying to win me. Why, what is not\\nto love, my dear? You will stop this ridiculous infatuation. You have made \\nyour point. Perhaps I was not making a point. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nPerhaps because of my past, perhaps a malformation of my heart. \\nI blame my father, of course. Cunt. I must take control of my circumstance.\\nI will need to act in a way that meets with the edges of my morality.\\nAnd when I end up on the street selling my asshole to syphilitic soldiers,\\nsteadfast morality will be a fucking nonsense that will mock me daily. \\nI\\'m not quite following. Shh. I apologize. But do \"shh\" when I\\'m thinking.\\nYour hair is so lustrous. It\\'s something people in court comment on. - \\nReally? - Mm-hmm. I always thought of it as rather nest-like. Not at all. FOOT\\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nLady Marlborough. I shall make you tea. What a lovely idea. Thank you, Abigail.\\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nOf course. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nPat the kids hello. Of course. You will give that speech on the tax increase\\nin parliament next week. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nI dreamed of the man on the roadside with one eye. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWhat man? We drove through town. He looked at me in such a way,\\nit made my blood chill. - So kind.\\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nAbigail, do you think the people are angry? Anne, she does not know. \\nWe should ask people. Get some people in from the villages and ask them. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> That is not how matters of state are dealt with.\\nPeople are led. They do not lead. Would you leave Marlborough exposed? \\nHe needs another battalion ready to join him, and that means money. \\nDo not shout at me. I am the queen. Then for once act like one. \\n[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Is the queen not riding today? Do not speak to me. \\n[MUSIC CONTINUES] [GAGS] [COUGHS] [MUSIC FADES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHING]\\nI have thought on the terms of our friendship. \\nI thought it was unconditional love. I will get you an audience with the \\nqueen if you ask her a favor for me. - Wench. You... Harley, you do not \\nneed me as an enemy. As it turns out, I am capable of much unpleasantness.\\nAs am I. - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYou\\'re so tiring, being like this. The queen has taken a shine to me, \\nand I will drip poison into her ear regarding you until she is mad with \\nhatred for you. Or we could have a mutually advantageous friendship. \\nCount of three. Yes or no? Well, if you\\'re so close to the queen, why\\nnot just ask this favor yourself? I do not want her to ever think I want\\nanything from her. - Have you counseled her for our side? - No. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nThe country\\'s future hangs in the balance. Mm-hmm. My thing is what I wish\\nto talk about. You do not care? I thought you were on our side. I\\'m on my side.\\nAlways. Sometimes, it\\'s a happy coincidence for you. Like now. You\\'ll get a \\nchance to save the country. [MOANING] [GRUNTING] \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nWhat tremendous luck to find you in the garden. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nWe were taking the air. You do not like the war, I know that. No, I do not,\\nbut we must fight for what we fight for. Godolphin and Lady Marlborough seem \\nto have corralled you so you do not get to hear from your loyal opposition.\\nI am briefed appropriately. Were it in person, I\\'d believe it. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nI am often ill. - \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nTrue. Sadly true. The war with the French will bleed us dry even if we win.\\nWe are in our strongest position now. If Marlborough loses this next battle,\\nwe could lose all. The people hate the war, you realize, they begin to hate you.\\nLady Marlborough has not told you of the riots in Leeds? No, she has not. - \\nAll I ask is that you search your heart. - Of course. Not Lady Marlborough\\'s \\nheart, your own. I must talk to you of your maid also. - Abigail? - \\nI believe that is her name. It seems Colonel Masham has fallen for her. \\nHe wishes to marry. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nShe\\'s just a maid. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nIt is irregular and inexplicable, but being sentimental, I am moved to help\\nif possible. What do you mean she\\'s not been seen? \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nShe took a horse, Your Majesty. It did not come back and nor did she. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nI shall send riders. No. I think she means to vex me. Do not send riders. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nIn case she has fallen, though. She\\'s too good a rider for that. \\nI know what she is. Do not seek her. [GRUNTING AND GROANING] Where am I? \\nYou\\'re in heaven. That\\'s God. You\\'ll meet him later. - I must go. - \\nI don\\'t think that\\'s happening. \\n\\n<speaker>WOMAN</speaker> \\nLie back. [INHALES SHARPLY] \\n\\n<speaker>WOMAN</speaker> \\nStop infection. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nGet Lady Marlborough. Now! Take me to her! Find her. Find her! \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nThere are wolves out there, are there not? \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> No, Your Majesty. I don\\'t think so. Perhaps \\nshe\\'s gone to Blenheim, her palace? There is no palace yet. It is the woods. \\nWe should check in the trees, just to be sure. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nMr. Harley! - I apologize. I hope we find her, and she\\'s not dead in a ditch.\\nThe business of state, however, cannot stop. Your Majesty, there has been no\\nword from the front in two weeks. There is no doubt that Marlborough is in \\ntrouble. We need to send a division immediately to help him. Costing a fortune,\\nbuilt on your paranoia, and walking into God knows what. We need to wait. \\nI will think on it for a while. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nThis cannot wait. We need to act now. Is it a bit like going late to your party?\\nIf the party\\'s going well, they did not need you, and they resent the \\nintrusion. But if it\\'s going badly, you cannot save it, and you tend to regret\\never putting on your nice gown for it. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nIt is not like a party. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI\\'m sorry, Prime Minister, a passing thought. I think it is like a party. - \\nA perfect analogy. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nWe will wait. Make sure they have their best dresses on so they\\'re ready \\nat a moment\\'s notice. Shift a division to the coast and have a boat at the\\nready. Abigail. I worry something has befallen her. It\\'s night. Out there alone.\\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nShe\\'s strong. - And she\\'ll be fine. - Yes. She saved me my whole life. \\nWithout her, I\\'m nothing. That is not true. - You are the queen. - I\\'m tired. \\nIt hurts. Everything hurts. Everyone leaves me. Dies. Finally her. If she\\'s \\nnot dead, I will cut her throat. She may be doing this to hurt me, make me \\ndissolve and dissemble. I will not. She will be fine. They will find her. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nI don\\'t care. You are a beautiful person. You glow with loveliness. \\nWe will marry you. - What? - Colonel Masham wishes to marry you. - He does? - \\nYes, you\\'ve quite captured him. That is absurd. I have nothing to offer. \\nI\\'m a penniless servant. It would be career suicide for him. Your first thought\\nis for him? Oh, you are a darling. I care for him. Not in the way I care for \\nyou, but enough to marry. I will not lie, I would like to be a lady again. \\nYes, yes, this is right. While she is gone. If we wait, she\\'ll return and yell\\nand stomp about it. But you must have this. This is my gift to you, and I \\ndemand you take it. Of course. When... Let\\'s... Now. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] \\nI, Abigail Hill, take thee, Samuel Masham, to be my lawful wedded husband. \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nI, Samuel Masham, take thee, Abigail Hill, to be my lawful wedded wife. \\n[CLAPPING] It is most generous. I am overwhelmed. - Shall we say \"gambling\\ndebts,\" Mr. Harley? - Excellent. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nOh, and you are to take apartments in the east wing. - \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nThank you, Your Majesty. - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nThank you. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nOh, it is fun to be queen sometimes. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nHmm. One can only imagine. [MUSIC CONTINUES] \\n\\n<speaker>MASHAM</speaker> \\nYou\\'re looking the wrong way. Where could she have gone? \\nYou sent riders looking for her? I have told you before. She would be sick\\nfor several days, but she would be near recovered by now. She probably went\\nback to Southampton. To do what? To plan what? To get ready? I am as hard as\\na rock, and it is our wedding night. Lie still. [MASHAM GRUNTS] Now that she\\nis gone, I find myself more concerned than when she was here. For it is like\\nshe could strike from anywhere at any time, and I will not see it coming. \\n[MASHAM EXHALES] I must be calm. She\\'s gone. I\\'m married. [MASHAM GROANS] \\nBut I must be ready. And yet, how to be ready when I do not know where my \\nenemy is? My life is like a maze I continually think I have gotten out of, \\nonly to find another corner right in front of me. [MASHAM GROANS] [MUSIC ENDS]\\n- [RHYTHMIC CREAKING] - [MUFFLED MOANING] Boy, fetch me a carriage. Mae says no.\\nI\\'m leaving. Help me up. Mae says no. Are you feeling better, then? \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nIs my horse alive, or did you eat it? I sold it. You still owe me, though. \\nYou can suck for your supper from now on. I\\'ll take 20%. You seem posh. \\nGents will like that. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nHave you ever seen ten gold sovereigns? - MAE: In my dreams. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nGo to Hyde Park fountain at 9:00 in the morning, and you will see a man \\nwalking a duck. [CHUCKLES] What happened? Are you all right? That cunt, \\nAbigail, poisoned me. Mary Magdalene here found me. Did they rape you? \\nNo, they didn\\'t. But gainful employment is on offer should I need it. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nAbigail did this? Yes. How goes the kingdom? Music Music for a while Shall\\nall your cares beguile Shall all All, all Shall all All, all Shall all your\\ncares beguile Wondering Wondering How your pains were eased Eased Eased And\\ndisdaining to be pleased From their eternal - Eternal - \\n[SOFT, INDISTINCT CHATTER] \\n\\n<speaker>SINGER</speaker> Eternal bands Till the snakes \\nDrop, drop Drop, drop Drop, drop [MUSIC STOPS] Lady Marlborough. Oh, dear.\\nThe servant is dressed in the clothes of a lady. How... whimsical. \\nMy dear friend and cousin, how good to see you\\'ve returned from... \\nHell. I\\'m sure you shall pass through it one day. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYou\\'ve missed a few things. My marriage. It was a simple affair, \\nbut beautifully done. [SCOFFS] Everyone leave. If you offer me tea,\\nyou will forgive me if I don\\'t accept. I have searched my heart, \\nand I did not have trust in it, and that is my shame. I could not just\\nstand by and let you destroy me. You have perhaps taught me that. \\nBut it\\'s over now. I have won. I am safe. We do not have to fight anymore.\\nIs that not grand? If you just forgive me, we can be happy together. \\n[ABIGAIL GRUNTS] Obviously, you still have some anger to expiate. \\nI\\'ll allow it this once. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nCongratulations on your wedded bliss. [SNICKERS] \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nYour face. Do I look that bad? If I were a man, it\\'d be quite dashing,\\na scar like this. Where have you been, Sarah? Why did you leave like that?\\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nI went riding. Some bandits attacked me. It took me a while to fight them off.\\nOh, your poor face. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou should see them. And you\\'ve been well taken care of, I trust. \\nSome men were eventually sent to find me, I hear. I was worried for you.\\nI thought you... You did not do it to try and hurt me? I do not play games\\nwith you. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nNo, I know, I know. Look at me. I will say this once and plainly, my \\ndearest one. You must send Abigail away. From my heart, Mrs. Morley, do it. \\nI do not want to. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nShe is a viper. [FOOTSTEPS] You\\'re jealous. - You will do as I say. - \\n[KNOCKING] - FOOT\\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nThe prime minister and Mr. Harley. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWhat is it? \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nA thousand pardons, Your Majesty, but word from the front. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWhat has happened? - Marlborough is ready. He has them outflanked. \\nHe needs a garrison to attack the coast. Let them go to the party now. \\nOf course, Your Majesty. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWhat party? It happened while you were gone. Thank you, gentlemen. \\nKeep me informed of progress. It is good to see you home and looking so well,\\nLady Marlborough. Now, you did very well with the divisions. - \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nYes, I know I did. - However, the two new cabinet positions, \\nthey must stay with the Whigs. I am the queen. Do not try to do that \\nthing you do. Do not try to manage this, as you cannot. I know that Harley\\nhas been in your ear and Abigail in your bed. Enough! You will be as I wish\\nyou to be from now on. Do you understand? Anne. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nDon\\'t. No, don\\'t. No, your face frightens me. Don\\'t! - [SARAH COUGHS] - \\nGood night, Lady Marlborough. Morning. Morning. What a strange sight you are,\\nmy dear. It is better, though. [ANNE YAWNS] I think I\\'m becoming quite \\nsentimental as I get older. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nDidn\\'t think you had the capacity for sentimentality. I didn\\'t think so either.\\n.. but so much is surprising me lately. I started looking over some of the \\nmany, many, many letters you\\'ve written me. \"I long for your embrace. I long\\nfor the heat from your naked body on mine.\" It\\'s very intense, very explicit\\n. I thought I\\'d misplaced some of them the other day. It was quite a fright.\\nWhat if, say, that son of a bitch, Jonathan Swift, got his hands on them? \\nIn his newspaper the next day. You would be ruined. You would never. \\nYou have no idea what I would do for my country... and for you. Ruin me? \\nYou would do that? I will use these letters, unless you announce the tax rise,\\nchange the cabinet as I wish, and get rid of Abigail. \\n[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Do you not wish to know what I\\'ve decided? \\nI wish to know that you are happy, and that your spirit will lighten once\\nthis is done. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DOOR OPENS] The queen requests the return \\nof your key. You will return it and vacate court today. Where is she? \\n\\n<speaker>COURTIER</speaker> \\nYou will hand over the key. The queen will not grant you an audience. \\n[DOOR CLOSES] [MUSIC FADES] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nAnne? I handed over my key. Mrs. Morley, you are angry, I know. I am sorry.\\nI went quite mad for a moment. Just open the door. - Please, just... Could you\\njust... - [KNOCKING] Mrs. Morley, open the door. I burned the letters. \\nI burned them. Oh, do what you will. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nBut I will not come back. Do you understand? I will go and be gone. \\nAbigail has done this. She does not love you. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nBecause how could anyone? She wants nothing from me, unlike you. \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nShe wants nothing from you, and yet somehow she is a lady, with 2,000 a year,\\nand Harley sits on your knee most nights. I wish you could love me as she does.\\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nYou wish me to lie to you? Oh. \"You look like a... a... an angel fell from \\nheaven, Your Majesty.\" No. Sometimes, you look like a badger. - And you can\\nrely on me to tell you. - Why? Because I will not lie! That is love! \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nI have my duties to attend to. [FOOTSTEPS] I have... I have, over the last\\nseveral months, been unhappy with the government. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Lord\\nGodolphin has lost my confidence. Therefore, I am announcing a new prime\\nminister... will be Mr. Harley. Godolphin, I thank you for your service.\\nWe will sue for peace with France immediately. I have spoken! All depart!\\n[CHEERING, MURMURING] Leave that. I like it. The mirrors stay, too. Oh, my God.\\nYou actually think you have won. Haven\\'t I? We were playing very different \\ngames. All I know is, your carriage awaits, and my maid is on her way up \\nwith something called a pineapple. DRIVER: Go? Go. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]\\nDo it again! [CHEERING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] - [DOOR OPENS] - [ABIGAIL GIGGLES]\\nI\\'m here. Will you do my legs, please? Of course. Hot towels, now. \\nAre you drunk? I\\'ve had wine. Very good wine. You should have some. \\nI\\'ll get you some. It would ease you. No. I don\\'t understand these papers. \\nI\\'m feeling unwell. Excuse me a moment, please. [COUGHS] [MUSIC FADES] Sorry. \\nI am unwell. Why, lay down. I\\'ll call the doctor for you, my love. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\n[SIGHS] Thank you, thank you. [BELL RINGS] \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nDoctor. - \\n\\n<speaker>SARAH</speaker> \\nWhat goes on? - \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nThey\\'ve brokered a peace with the French, giving up too much, of course.\\nOf course. Marlborough returns in a week. Harley will move to have him \\nreplaced. - Now that peace with France has been made... - [CROWD CHEERS] \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nMarlborough\\'s return back to England is imminent. I wonder, Your Majesty,\\nwhether it is right that he is left as head of our forces? I will rip\\nhis mole from his face. You must stop it, Godolphin. He is a hero who\\nwon the peace for us. Indeed, but he would have launched us into a bloody\\nwar that would have ruined us, so there\\'s that. It would be easier to pull\\nmy strings if you were back at court. A new era of peace and prosperity,\\na new day, a door to a new future. There\\'s metaphors abound. I\\'m tired.\\nI will think on it. Thank you, all. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nObviously, you have chosen to keep the particulars of your dismissal from me.\\nI shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that. I do not know\\nof women and their feelings, but I know they nurse their hurts like wailing\\nnewborns. Godolphin, I feel a surge of desire to see your nose broken. \\nYour point? Your Majesty, may I broach the matter of Lady Marlborough? \\nNo, you may not. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nA breach in a dear friendship. Surely this could be healed. Some wounds do\\nnot close. I have many such. One just walks around with them, and sometimes \\none can feel them filling with blood. A letter. An apology of some sort that \\nfacilitates your return. There are limits to what one can give. Perhaps she \\ncould write you, and we could attempt to repair at least one wound in our \\nqueen? Cannot stop her. I imagine it\\'d be pointless, and I would dash the \\nletter into the fire, but I cannot stop her. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] \\n\"You... cunt.\" \"My God, I miss you.\" Are you sure this is all of the mail? \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nYou seek something? No, I... A fabric piece from  my cousin in Florence. \\nI\\'m sure it will come. \"I dreamt I stabbed you in the eye.\" [MUSIC CONTINUES] \\nThis cannot be all of it. - It is, ma\\'am. - Don\\'t lean at me! Shall we request\\nanother fabric piece from your cousin in Florence? Perhaps it was lost or\\neaten by mice on the long journey. No, I just want to know that all my mail\\nis here. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nOf course. Footman, go and check again. Immediately. Incompetent. \\n\"My dearest... Mrs. Morley... I...\" [MUSIC ENDS] I am in a quandary... \\nand you are my dearest one. I do not know whether to speak of it. What is it?\\n- I\\'m not sure. - I don\\'t like this. You\\'ll lodge this unknowable thing in my\\nbrain, and it will eat me with horrible possibilities. \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nIt is not horrible, dear Anne. It is just money. Money? I have found in the\\nbooks... large sums of money seem to have flowed to Marlborough, but are not\\nreflected in the forces\\' receipts of expenses. What? It is gone. Shall I \\nrequest it back on his return? Quietly, perhaps? Are you saying that Sarah \\ndiverted money to him? It does seem so. Some 7,000. \\n\\n<speaker>ANNE</speaker> \\nShe would not. - It is just... - She would not. I\\'m, of course, perhaps \\nmistaken in the bookkeeping. Sometimes all these numbers are dizzying, and\\nthey\\'re as fickle as humans. They often do add up on the second or third \\nattempt. There\\'s a simple explanation I\\'m not seeing. We shall banish it from\\nour minds. Shall we take the children for a walk in the garden? No, thank you.\\nI need to rest. You may leave. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [DOOR OPENS]\\nI need to put it back. Be gone. [DOOR CLOSES] Marlborough is at Southampton.\\nWe need a decision. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nYour Majesty, if I may... There was very little mail today. \\n\\n<speaker>HARLEY</speaker> \\nQuite. If I may, the situation with Marlborough? He is stealing from me. \\n\\n<speaker>GODOLPHIN</speaker> \\nWhat? Your Majesty, that is preposterous. Lady Abigail, privy purse, is it not\\ntrue they have stolen from me? Damaged us? Yes. It is all there in black and \\nwhite. She must be ruined, banished from their beloved England. They are not \\nloyal. They would hurt us, our country, the queen. - Your Majesty, if I may...\\n- No, you may not! He will be charged. They will be banished. I have spoken. \\nGet out! Ah, the mail is here. I suddenly feel so tired of England, my darling.\\nPerhaps we should go somewhere else. [SIGHS] [RABBIT SQUEALS] [RABBIT SQUEALS]\\n[PIANO MELODY STARTS] - [THUD] - [ANNE GRUNTS] Anne? Darling Anne? Let\\'s get\\nyou in a chair. How dare you touch the queen like that! - \\n\\n<speaker>ABIGAIL</speaker> \\nI\\'m sorry. - I did not ask you to speak. [PANTING] Rub my leg. [MELODY BUILDS]\\n- You should lie down. - You shall speak when asked to. [PANTING] I feel dizzy.\\nI need to hold on to something. [ANNE PANTING] [MELODY BUILDS] \\n[MELODY DISTORTS] [MELODY FADES] [HARPSICHORD PLAYING] \\n\\n<speaker>MAN</speaker> \\nTurn me loose From your hands Let me fly To distant lands Over green fields \\nTrees and mountains Flowers And forest fountains Home along the lanes Of the \\nskyway For this dark And lonely room Projects a shadow Cast in gloom And my \\neyes are mirrors Of the world outside Thinking of the way That the wind Can \\nturn the tide And these shadows turn From purple into gray For just a skyline\\npigeon Dreaming of the open Waiting for the day That he can spread his wings \\nAnd fly away again Fly away Skyline pigeon, fly Towards the dreams You\\'ve left\\nSo very far behind Fly away Skyline pigeon, fly Towards the dreams You\\'ve left\\nSo very far behind Just let me wake up In the morning To the smell of new-mown\\nhay To laugh and cry To live and die In the brightness of my day I want to hear\\nThe pealing bells Of distant churches sing But most of all Please free me From\\nthis aching metal ring And open out this cage Towards the sun For just this sky\\nline pigeon Dreaming of the open Waiting for the day He can spread his wings And\\nfly away again Fly away Skyline pigeon, fly Towards the things You\\'ve left So \\nvery far behind Fly away Skyline pigeon, fly Towards the things You\\'ve left So\\nvery So very far Behind [AMBIENT NATURE SOUNDS] [AMBIENT NATURE SOUNDS CONTINUE]\\n[AMBIENT NATURE SOUNDS CONTINUE]\\n'"

moralityand when i end up on the street selling my asshole to syphilitic soldierssteadfast morality will be a fucking nonsense that will mock me daily im not quite following shh i apologize but do \"shh\" when im thinkingyour hair is so lustrous its something people in court comment on  really  mmhmm i always thought of it as rather nestlike not at all foot<speaker>man</speaker> lady marlborough i shall make you tea what a lovely idea thank you abigail<speaker>abigail</speaker> of course  <speaker>anne</speaker> pat the kids hello of course you will give that speech on the tax

my blood chill  so kind<speaker>anne</speaker> abigail do you think the people are angry anne she does not know we should ask people get some people in from the villages and ask them <speaker>sarah</speaker> that is not how matters of state are dealt withpeople are led they do not lead would you leave marlborough exposed he needs another battalion ready to join him and that means money do not shout at me i am the queen then for once act like one [classical music playing] is the queen not riding today do not speak to me [music continues] [gags] [coughs] [music fades] [indistinct chatter laughing]i have thought on the terms of our friendship i thought it was unconditional love i will get you an audience with the queen if you ask her a favor for me  wench you harley you do not need me as an enemy as it turns out i am capable of much unpleasantnessas am i  <speaker>abigail</speaker> youre so tiring being like this the queen has taken a shine to me and i will drip poison into her ear regarding you until she is mad with hatred for you or we could have a mutually advantageous friendship count of three yes or no well if youre so close to the queen whynot just ask this favor yourself i do not want her to ever think i wantanything from her  have you counseled her for our side  no <speaker>harley</speaker> the countrys future hangs in the balance mmhmm my thing

[grunting] <speaker>harley</speaker> what tremendous luck to find you in the garden <speaker>anne</speaker> we were taking the air you do not like the war i know that no i do notbut we must fight for what we fight for godolphin and lady marlborough seem to have corralled you so you do not get to hear from your loyal oppositioni am briefed appropriately were it in person id believe it  <speaker>anne</speaker> i am often ill  <speaker>harley</speaker> true sadly true the war with the french will bleed us dry even if we winwe are in our strongest position now if marlborough loses this next battlewe could lose all the people hate the war you realize they begin to hate youlady marlborough has not told you of the riots in leeds no she has not  all i ask is that you search your heart  of course not lady marlboroughs heart your own i must talk to you of your maid also  abigail  i believe that is her name it seems colonel masham has fallen for her he wishes to marry <speaker>anne</speaker> shes just a maid <speaker>harley</speaker> it is irregular and inexplicable but being sentimental i am moved to helpif possible what do you mean shes not been seen <speaker>masham</speaker> she took a horse your majesty it did not come back and nor did she <speaker>godolphin</speaker> i shall send riders no i think she means to vex me do not send riders <speaker>godolphin</speaker> in case she has fallen though shes too good a rider for that i know what she is do not seek her [grunting and groaning] where am i youre in heaven thats god youll meet him later  i must go  i dont think thats happening <speaker>woman</speaker> lie back [inhales sharply] <speaker>woman</speaker> stop infection <speaker>anne</speaker> get lady marlborough now! take me to her! find her find her! <speaker>anne</speaker> there are wolves out there are there not <speaker>godolphin</speaker> no your majesty i dont think so perhaps shes gone to blenheim her palace there is no palace yet it is the woods we should check in the trees just to be sure  <speaker>anne</speaker> mr harley!  i apologize i hope we find her and shes not dead in a ditchthe business of state however cannot stop your majesty there has been noword from the front in two weeks there is no doubt that marlborough is in trouble we need to send a division immediately to help him costing a fortunebuilt on your paranoia and walking into god knows what we need to wait i will think on it for a while <speaker>godolphin</speaker> this cannot wait we need to act now is it a bit like going late to your partyif the partys going well they did not need you and they resent the intrusion but if its going badly you cannot save it and you tend to regretever putting on your nice gown for it <speaker>godolphin</speaker> it is not like a party <speaker>abigail</speaker> im sorry prime minister a passing thought i think it is like a party  a perfect analogy  <speaker>anne</speaker> we will wait make sure they have their best dresses on so theyre ready at a moments notice shift a division to the coast and have a boat at theready abigail i worry something has befallen her its night out there alone<speaker>abigail</speaker> shes strong  and shell be fine  yes she saved me my whole life without her im nothing that is not true  you are the queen  im tired it hurts everything hurts

<speaker>anne</speaker> i dont care you are a beautiful person you glow with loveliness we will marry you  what  colonel masham wishes to marry you  he does  yes youve quite captured him that is absurd i have nothing to offer im a penniless servant it would be career suicide for him your first thoughtis for him oh you are a darling i care for him not in the way i care for you but enough to marry i will not lie i would like to be a lady again yes yes this is right while she is gone if we wait shell return and yelland stomp about it but you must have this this is my gift to you and i

moralityand when i end up on the street selling my asshole to syphilitic soldierssteadfast morality will be a fucking nonsense that will mock me daily im not quite following shh i apologize but do

my blood chill  so kind<speaker>anne</speaker> abigail do you think the people are angry anne she does not know we should ask people get some people in from the villages and ask them <speaker>sarah</speaker> that is not how matters of state are dealt withpeople are led they do not lead would you leave marlborough exposed he needs another battalion ready to join him and that means money do not shout at me i am the queen then for once act like one [classical music playing] is the queen not riding today do not speak to me [music continues] [gags] [coughs] [music fades]

you do not need me as an enemy as it turns out i am capable of much unpleasantnessas am i  <speaker>abigail</speaker> youre so tiring being like this the queen has taken a shine to me and i will drip poison into her ear regarding you until she is mad with hatred for you or we could have a mutually advantageous friendship count of three yes or no well if youre so close to the queen whynot just ask this favor yourself i do not want her to ever think i wantanything from her  have you counseled her for our side  no <speaker>harley</speaker> the countrys future hangs in the balance mmhmm my thing

[grunting] <speaker>harley</speaker> what tremendous luck to find you in the garden <speaker>anne</speaker> we were taking the air you do not like the war i know that no i do notbut we must fight for what we fight for godolphin and lady marlborough seem to have corralled you so you do not get to hear from your loyal oppositioni am briefed appropriately were it in person id believe it  <speaker>anne</speaker> i am often ill  <speaker>harley</speaker> true sadly true the war with the french will bleed us dry even if we winwe are in our strongest position now if marlborough loses this next battlewe could lose all the people hate the war you realize they begin to hate youlady marlborough has not told you of the riots in leeds no she has not  all i ask is that you search your heart  of course not lady marlboroughs heart your own i must talk to you of your maid also  abigail  i believe that is her name it seems colonel masham has fallen for her he wishes to marry <speaker>anne</speaker> shes just a maid <speaker>harley</speaker> it is irregular and inexplicable but being sentimental i am moved to helpif possible what do you mean shes not been seen <speaker>masham</speaker> she took a horse your majesty it did not come back and nor did she <speaker>godolphin</speaker> i shall send riders no i think she means to vex me do not send riders <speaker>godolphin</speaker> in case she has fallen though shes too good a rider for that i know what she is do not seek her [grunting and groaning] where am i youre in heaven thats god youll meet him later  i must go  i dont think thats happening <speaker>woman</speaker> lie back [inhales sharply] <speaker>woman</speaker> stop infection <speaker>anne</speaker> get lady marlborough now! take me to

cannot stop your majesty there has been noword from the front in two weeks there is no doubt that marlborough is in trouble we need to send a division immediately to help him costing a fortunebuilt on your paranoia and walking into god knows what we need to wait i will think on it for a while <speaker>godolphin</speaker> this cannot wait we need to act now is it a bit like going late to your partyif the partys going well they did not need you and they resent the intrusion but if its going badly you cannot save it and you tend to regretever putting on your nice gown for it <speaker>godolphin</speaker> it is not like a party <speaker>abigail</speaker> im sorry prime minister a passing thought i think it is like a party  a perfect analogy  <speaker>anne</speaker> we will wait make sure they have their best dresses on so theyre ready at a moments notice shift a division to the coast and have a boat at theready abigail i worry something has befallen her its night out there alone<speaker>abigail</speaker> shes strong  and shell be fine  yes she saved me my whole life without her im nothing that is not true  you are the queen  im tired it hurts everything hurts

<speaker>anne</speaker> i dont care you are a beautiful person you glow with loveliness we will marry you  what  colonel masham wishes to marry you  he does  yes youve quite captured him that is absurd i have nothing to offer im a penniless servant it would be career suicide for him your first thoughtis for him oh you are a darling i care for him not in the way i care for you but enough to

The story of home. Millions of years ago... \\na meteorite made of vibranium... the strongest substance in the universe... \\nstruck the continent of Africa... affecting the plant life around it. \\nAnd when the time of man came... five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. \\nThe tribes lived in constant war with each other... until a warrior shaman... \\nreceived a vision from the Panther Goddess Bast... who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb... \\na plant that granted him superhuman strength, speed and instincts. The warrior became king... \\nand the first Black Panther... the protector of Wakanda. Four tribes agreed to live under the king\\'s rule... \\nbut the Jabari Tribe isolated themselves in the mountains. The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology... \\nmore advanced than any other nation. But as Wakanda thrived... the world around it descended further into chaos. \\nTo keep vibranium safe... the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight... \\nkeeping the truth of their power from the outside world. And we still hide, Baba? Yes. \\n\\n<speaker>BOY</speaker> \\nWhy? (IN THE TRUNK BY TOO $HORT PLAYING) - Lucky shot! - That ain\\'t lucky! Whatever! \\nGet outta here! Check up. Pick your man up!

This man... Ulysses Klaue... stole a quarter ton of vibranium from us... \\nand triggered a bomb at the border to escape. Many lives were lost. He knew where we hid the vibranium... \\nand how to strike. He had someone on the inside. Why are you here? Because I want you to look me in the eyes... \\nand tell me why you betrayed Wakanda. I did no such thing. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Tell him who you are. Zuri, son of Badu... \\nWhat? James. James, you lied to me? Leave him. You were Wakandan this whole time? You betrayed Wakanda! \\nHow could you lie to me like... Stand down. Did you think that you were the only spy we sent here?

Yo. \\n\\n<speaker>REPORTER</speaker> \\nThe tiny nation of Wakanda is mourning the death of its monarch, King T\\'Chaka. \\nThe beloved ruler was one of many confirmed dead... after a terrorist attack at the United Nations a week ago. \\nThe suspect has since been apprehended. Though it remains one of the poorest countries in the world... \\nfortified by mountain ranges... and an impenetrable rainforest... \\nWakanda does not engage in international trade or accept aid.

You\\'re a good man with a good heart. \\nAnd it\\'s hard for a good man to be king. (GASPING) Breathe. \\nT\\'Challa, breathe. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Breathe. He was there. \\n(CHUCKLES) He was there. My father. (BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO PLAYING) \\nJust one? Come home, Nakia. I\\'m right here. \\nStay. I came to support you and to honor your father... \\nbut I can\\'t stay. I found my calling out there. I\\'ve seen too many in need \\njust to turn a blind eye. I can\\'t be happy here... knowing that there\\'s \\npeople out there who have nothing. What would you have Wakanda do about it? \\nShare what we have. We could provide aid... and access to technology and \\nrefuge to those who need it. Other countries do it, we could do it better. \\nWe are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what \\nwe truly are... what we possess... we could lose our way of life. Wakanda \\nis strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time. \\n(SIGHS) If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen. \\nI would make a great queen because I am so stubborn. - Ah! See, you admit it!\\n- If that\\'s what I wanted. \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nIs that him? Glory to Bast, man. \\nIs he still growing? \\n\\n<speaker>W\\'KABI</speaker> \\nOf course. I see Nakia is back. \\nYou guys going to work it out? T\\'Challa... what\\'s wrong? \\nNakia thinks we should be doing more. More, like what? \\nForeign aid, refugee programs. You let the refugees in... \\nthey bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is \\nlike everywhere else. Now if you said you wanted me and my men... \\nto go out there and clean up the world, then I\\'ll be all for it. \\nBut waging war on other countries has never been our way. \\n(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING) You, too, huh? Bast! We\\'re in trouble. \\nMy King. My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar. \\nA misidentified Wakandan artifact... was stolen yesterday from a British museum. \\nWe have learned Ulysses Klaue... plans to sell the vibranium to an American buyer... \\nin South Korea... tomorrow night. Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost \\n30 years. Not capturing him is, perhaps, my father\\'s greatest regret. \\nI wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial. Wakanda does not need \\na warrior right now. We need a king. My parents were killed when he \\nattacked. Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took \\nfrom us. From me. It\\'s too great an opportunity to pass. \\n\\n<speaker>W\\'KABI</speaker> \\nTake me with you. We\\'ll take him down together, side by side. \\nI need you here protecting the border. Then I ask... you kill \\nhim where he stands... or you bring him back to us. You have my \\nword. I will bring him back. We will proceed with the mission. \\n(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) My King! - Stop it. Stop it. - \\n(CHUCKLES) I\\'ve already sent a car ahead to Busan for you. \\nWho are you taking with you to Korea? Okoye. And Nakia as well. \\nYou sure it\\'s a good idea to take your ex on a mission? \\nYes. We\\'ll be fine. Besides, you\\'ll be on call should we need backup. \\nYes! I have great things to show you, Brother. Here are your \\ncommunication devices for Korea. Unlimited range, also equipped with \\naudio surveillance system. Check these out. Remote access Kimoyo Beads.\\nUpdated to interface directly with my sand table. \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nAh. And what are these? The real question is (SHOUTS) what are those? \\n(CHUCKLES) Why do you have your toes out in my lab? What, you don\\'t like \\nmy royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day. I bet the \\nElders loved that. (CHUCKLES) Try them on. Fully automated. Like the old \\nAmerican movie Baba used to watch. \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nMmm. And I made them completely sound absorbent. \\nInteresting. Guess what I call them. Sneakers. Because you... \\nNever mind. If you\\'re going to take on Klaue... you\\'ll need the\\nbest the design group has to offer. Exhibit A. \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nMy design. \\n\\n<speaker>SHURI</speaker> \\nOld tech. - Old? - Functional, but old. \\n\"Hey, people are shooting at me. \"Wait, let me put on my helmet.\" \\n- Enough. - (CHUCKLES) Now, look at these. Do you like that one? \\nTempting. But the idea is to not be noticed. This one. (TRILLING) \\nNow tell it to go on. \\n\\n<speaker>SHURI</speaker> \\nOoh! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace. \\nStrike it. - Anywhere? - Mmm-hmm. Not that hard, genius! \\nYou told me to strike it. You didn\\'t say how hard. I invite\\nyou to my lab, and you just kick things around? Well, maybe \\nyou should make it a little stronger. Hey. Wait a minute. \\n\\n<speaker>SHURI</speaker> \\nThe nanites absorb the kinetic energy... and hold it in \\nplace for redistribution. Very nice. Strike it again in \\nthe same spot. (KIMOYO BEADS BEEP) You\\'re recording? \\nFor research purposes. (SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Delete \\nthat footage. (HANGOVER BY PSY AND SNOOP DOGG PLAYING) \\n(INDISTINCT CHATTER) This way. Bast willing, this will \\ngo quickly... and I can get this ridiculous thing off my \\nhead. It looks nice. Just whip it back and forth. What? \\nIt\\'s a disgrace. (IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia. Good to see you. \\nWho are these two? My friends from Kenya. Very deep pockets. \\nThey\\'re good. Good for trouble... ...like you? (EXCLAIMS) \\nThank you! (PRAY FOR ME BY THE WEEKND AND KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYING) \\nSpread out. The buyer is likely already here. The woman outside. \\nWhat trouble was she referring to? Ah... I got into a disagreement \\nwith some ivory traders. - Made a bit of a mess. - \\nHmm. And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan Heiress? \\nDepends... on how quickly we finish the mission. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\n(ON RADIO) Can we please focus? Thank you. (SPEAKING KOREAN) \\nOver here. One whiskey, please. Eyes up. Americans. I count three. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\nFive. How could you miss Greased Lightning there behind you? \\nSix. Just spotted an old friend who works for the CIA. It just got \\na little more complicated. Agent Ross. Your Highness. You are buying\\nfrom Klaue. What I\\'m doing or not doing... on behalf of the U.S. \\ngovernment is none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you\\'re up to...\\ndo me a favor, stay out of my way. I gave you Zemo. Didn\\'t I keep it under\\nwraps... that the king of a third world country runs around in a \\nbulletproof cat suit? I\\'d say we were even. You really need to leave, now.\\nKlaue is leaving out that door with me. You\\'ve been warned. \\n\\n<speaker>CROUPIER</speaker> \\nThree, craps. Hey, you won! You know what? I think I\\'ll just take these... \\nbring them over here - and hold on for safekeeping. - <speaker>ROSS</speaker> Mmm-hmm. \\nOkay, heads up. The king of Wakanda is here. He cannot leave with Klaue. \\nAll right. Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person... \\nthat I\\'m not actually saying I\\'m here to make a deal with... but that deal\\nwill not be called off. When the dust settles, you and me can work \\nsomething out. I\\'m not here to make a deal. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO)\\n(DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING) Klaue, plus eight! General. In position to \\nsecure our exit. And the vibranium? I don\\'t see it yet. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\nI thought there were no weapons allowed in here. \\nThere\\'s not supposed to be. Somebody did not get the memo. \\nDefinitely armed. Well, that is quite the entourage. \\nYou got a mixtape coming out? Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) \\nYeah, actually, there is one. I\\'ll send you the SoundCloud link,\\nif you like. Hey, Dave, can you get the link to the tape? \\nPlease, don\\'t make me listen to your music. I just meant you got a\\nlot of people with you. (CHUCKLES) You think they\\'re for you? \\nDon\\'t worry. I can do a deal with you all by myself, thank you very much. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\nSix more. It\\'s a setup. You got the diamonds? Okay. That\\'s enough. - \\nWe need to move on Klaue. - \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nStand down. We can\\'t afford a shootout. Vibranium? I was going to \\nbuy a fancy suitcase... but I thought I\\'d save myself some money. \\nIt\\'s now or never. (IN XHOSA) Stand down! Hey! (SPEAKS XHOSA) (GRUNTING)\\n(CROWD SCREAMING) Wakandans! They\\'re here! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nGet outta here! <speaker>KLAUE</speaker> Kill \\'em all! Diamonds, quick! (ALL GRUNTING) \\n(YELLS) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Murderer! (GUN CLICKING) You know, you look just\\nlike your old man. (WEAPON POWERING UP) (GRUNTS) I made it rain! (LAUGHS)\\nLet\\'s get out of here, boss! That was awesome! That was awesome! Let\\'s go!\\nGo, go, go, come on! - Do we just leave him? - He\\'ll catch up. (DEVICE BEEPS)\\nShuri! Yes! \\n\\n<speaker>AUTOMATED VOICE</speaker> \\nRemote driving system activated.\\nWait! Which side of the road is it? \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nFor Bast\\'s sake! - Just drive! - Okay, calm down! Whoo! \\nLet\\'s go! Put some music on. What do you think this is, a funeral? \\n(UPBEAT RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Which one is he in now? Hey, split up! - \\nThey\\'re trying to lose us. - I\\'ll take the right. We\\'ll take the other two!\\nI see a shortcut. (TIRES SCREECH) We\\'re not going to make it! \\n\\n<speaker>BLACK PANTHER</speaker> \\nKeep going! Whoo! Brother! (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS) Hey, what was that? \\n\\n<speaker>BLACK PANTHER</speaker> \\nDon\\'t worry about it. You\\'re doing great. Guns. So primitive! \\nIt\\'s a vibranium car, you idiots! The bullets won\\'t penetrate! \\nWhat are you doing? Just drive. (MEN YELL) - Whoo! - Shit! \\nHey, look at your suit. You\\'ve been taking bullets, charging it up \\nwith kinetic energy. \\n\\n<speaker>BLACK PANTHER</speaker> \\nPull around the truck. Where\\'d he go? You show-off. \\nThere he is! Hold tight! (ENGINE REVS) All right. \\nLet\\'s have some fun! (GRUNTING) (STRAINING) (PANTING) Hop in. \\nPut that spear in the trunk. \\n\\n<speaker>BLACK PANTHER</speaker> \\nFaster, Shuri. I\\'m going as fast as I can! Take a right! \\nTake a right! (TIRES SCREECH) No, no, no! (GRUNTS) Brother! \\n(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) (GROANING AND PANTING) \\n\\n<speaker>BLACK PANTHER</speaker> \\nKlaue! Did you think we would forget? (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) Look at me,\\nmurderer! Where did you get this weapon? You savages didn\\'t deserve it. - \\n(GRUNTS) - (GROANS) Oh, mercy, King. Mercy. Every breath you take is mercy\\nfrom me. (IN XHOSA) King! The world watches. Let\\'s go, huh? \\n(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) Yeah. <speaker>KLAUE</speaker> Hello. (GIGGLES) \\nI can see you! I can. I can see you. (CACKLING) (AIR KISSES) \\n(SPLUTTERING) So this is a big mess, huh? I figured we could go good cop,\\nbad cop. I\\'ll talk to him first, then you guys go in. (SPEAKING XHOSA) \\nWe can\\'t let him talk to Klaue alone. Better to let him talk to Klaue alone\\nfor 5 minutes than to make a scene here. After your questioning, \\nwe will take him back to Wakanda with us. What? No. Look, I like you, \\na lot. But he\\'s in my custody now. He\\'s not going anywhere. \\nListen, I\\'m doing you guys a favor by letting you even be in here. \\n(SPEAKING XHOSA) If he touches you again, I\\'m going to impale him \\nto this desk. Does she speak English? When she wants to. Huh. I\\'m going in. \\nWhen I\\'m done, you guys are up. - Agent Ross. - Yeah? I do appreciate your \\nhelp in Busan. You see that? It\\'s called diplomacy. You\\'re welcome. \\n(KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN AND JUNIOR TORELLO) - Okoye. -\\n(SCOFFS) Play nice. Americans. (KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING) (ROSS CLEARS THROAT) \\nYou know, you really shouldn\\'t trust the Wakandans. I\\'m much more your speed. \\nI don\\'t trust anybody, not in this job. But what I am interested in \\nis that arm cannon out there. Where\\'d you get that? It\\'s an old mining \\ntool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one, if you like.\\nWhy don\\'t you give me the name of your supplier, and I\\'ll ask them. \\nHe\\'s right outside. Why don\\'t you ask him yourself? What? T\\'Challa?\\nYou\\'re telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda? Bingo. \\nWhat do you actually know about Wakanda? \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nUm... Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits. \\n\\n<speaker>KLAUE</speaker> \\n(ON EARPIECE) It\\'s all a front. Explorers searched for it for centuries.\\nEl Dorado, the Golden City. They thought they could find it in South America...\\nbut it was in Africa the whole time. A technological marvel. \\nAll because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man.\\nIsipho, they call it. The gift. Vibranium. Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal \\non earth. It\\'s not just a metal. They sew it into their clothes. It powers \\ntheir city, their tech... their weapons. Weapons? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Makes my\\narm cannon look like a leaf blower. That\\'s a nice fairy tale, but Wakanda is\\na third world country... and you stole all their vibranium. (LAUGHING) I stole...\\nAll of it? I took a tiny piece of it. They have a mountain full of it. \\nThey\\'ve been mining it for thousands of years... and they still haven\\'t\\nscratched the surface. I\\'m the only outsider who\\'s seen it and got out \\nof there alive. If you don\\'t believe me, you ask your friend what his \\nsuit is made of. What his claws are made of. (BEEPING) Your father told the UN...\\nthat Klaue stole all the vibranium you had. But now he\\'s telling me you have more.\\nAnd you believe the word of an arms dealer strapped to a chair? (TRUCK BEEPING)\\n(IN KOREAN) Where is that? Back there. How much more are you hiding? \\n(SPEAKING XHOSA) Something is happening out back. (YELLS) Get down! - \\n(KLAUE YELLING) - Stand down! \\n\\n<speaker>MAN #1</speaker> \\nCover! \\n\\n<speaker>MAN #2</speaker> \\nGrenade! I see you took your time, didn\\'t you? \\n(LAUGHS) (OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA) My King! My King. \\nNakia. He just jumped in front of me. \\n(LABORED BREATHING AND GRUNTING) I don\\'t think \\nhe\\'ll make it here. It hit his spine. Give me a Kimoyo Bead. \\n(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) This will stabilize him for now. \\n(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY) (EXHALING DEEPLY) Give him to us. We can save him. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\nOur mission was to bring back Klaue. We failed. \\nThis man is a foreign intelligence operative. \\nHow do we justify bringing him into our borders? He took a bullet for me. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\nThat was his choice. So now we are just supposed to let him die? \\nLet us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his \\ncountry. And as king, it is your duty to protect ours. I\\'m well aware of \\nmy duties, General. I cannot just let him die... knowing we can save him. \\nWhere exactly are we taking him? (UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) Great! \\nAnother broken white boy for us to fix. This is going to be fun. He will live.\\n- (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) - (MUSIC STOPS) W\\'Kabi is here. What\\'s going on, \\nbrother? Where is Klaue? He\\'s not here. (SIGHS) He slipped through our \\nhands. \"Slipped\"? For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing.\\nWith you, I thought it\\'d be different. But it\\'s more of the same. Let\\'s \\nget going, boss. You always sell to the CIA? I sell to the highest bidder.\\nBut don\\'t you worry. When I get back to Joburg... and I lay low for a bit, \\nI\\'ll make sure both you guys get paid. Oh, I ain\\'t worried about the money,\\nbro. I know you good for it. On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda. \\nYou don\\'t want to go there, boy. Yeah, I do. \\n\\n<speaker>KLAUE</speaker> \\nDrop it! Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today. \\nPut your gun down now! I\\'m sorry. - Sorry, Erik. - It\\'s gonna be okay. \\n(KLAUE GROANS) (GROANS) (KLAUE PANTING) You really want to go to Wakanda? \\nThey\\'re savages. This is what they do to people like us. \\n\\n<speaker>KILLMONGER</speaker> \\nI ain\\'t worried about no brand. Check these out. Each one is for a kill. \\nYou can scar yourself as much as you\\'d like. To them, you\\'ll just be an \\noutsider. You\\'re crazy to think that you can walk in there. Ah, to think \\nI saw you as some crazy American. (CHUCKLING) \\n\\n<speaker>T\\'CHALLA</speaker> \\nLeave us! So your mission did not go as planned. What happened to my uncle \\nN\\'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared. There was a man today... wearing \\na ring identical to this one. That is not possible. He helped Klaue escape \\nfrom us and he was wearing this ring! My grandfather\\'s ring! Do not tell me\\nwhat is possible. Tell me the truth! Some truths... are too much to bear, \\nT\\'Challa. That is not your choice to make. What happened to him? I promised\\nthe king to say nothing. I am your king now! Your uncle took... a War Dog \\nassignment in America. Your father... placed me there... to observe... \\nunbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They\\nhad a child. The hardships he saw there... radicalized your uncle. I observed\\nfor as long as I could. Their leaders have been assassinated. Communities \\nflooded with drugs and weapons. They are overly policed and incarcerated.\\nAll over the planet... our people suffer because they don\\'t have the tools\\nto fight back. With vibranium weapons, they could overthrow every country...\\nand Wakanda could rule them all the right way. He knew your father would not\\nsupport this. So, your uncle betrayed us. No! He helped Klaue steal the\\nvibranium. No, no, no. You will return home at once... where you will face \\nthe Council... and inform them of your crimes. \\n\\n<speaker>ZURI</speaker> \\nHe drew his weapon on me. - No! - (GRUNTING) \\n\\n<speaker>ZURI</speaker> \\nYour father killed his own brother... to save my life. Speak nothing of this.\\nAnd the child? We left him. We had to... maintain... the lie. What is this? \\nJust a little gift. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Who are you? (DEVICE WHIRRING) (GRUNTING)\\nAll right, where am I? Don\\'t scare me like that, colonizer! (STAMMERS) \\nWhat? My name is Everett. Yes, I know. Everett Ross... former air force \\npilot and now CIA. Right. Okay, is this Wakanda? No, it\\'s Kansas. How long\\nago was Korea? \\n\\n<speaker>SHURI</speaker> \\nYesterday. I don\\'t think so. Bullet wounds don\\'t just magically heal overnight.\\n(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) They do here. But not by magic, by technology. Don\\'t touch \\nanything. My brother will return soon. \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nThese train things... that\\'s magnetic levitation, right? Obviously. \\nObviously, but I\\'ve never seen it this efficient. The light panels, \\nwhat are they? - Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what? In its raw form... \\nvibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed... so I developed \\na way to temporarily deactivate it. \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nThere\\'s vibranium on those trains? There\\'s vibranium all around us. \\nThat\\'s how I healed you. (CHUCKLES) Where is T\\'Challa? His Kimoyo Beads\\nhave been switched off. Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye. A man\\nshowed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue. What? W\\'Kabi \\nis transporting him, as we speak, to the palace. We need to find your \\nbrother! An outsider? No, a Wakandan. He\\'s not a Wakandan. He\\'s one of ours.\\nHe killed his own brother... and left a child behind... with nothing. \\nWhat kind of king... What kind of man does that? No man is perfect. \\nNot even your father. He didn\\'t even give him a proper burial. \\nMy uncle N\\'Jobu betrayed us, but my father... he may have created \\nsomething even worse. Hey. Look at me. You can\\'t let your father\\'s mistakes\\ndefine who you are. You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be. \\n(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) Brother, you need to get here now! \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nErik Stevens. Graduated Annapolis age 19... MIT for grad school. \\nJoined the SEALs and went straight to Afghanistan... where he wrapped\\nup confirmed kills, like it was a video game. Started calling him Killmonger.\\nHe joined a JSOC ghost unit. Now these guys are serious. They will drop off\\nthe grid... so they can commit assassinations and take down governments. \\nDid he reveal anything about his identity? \\n\\n<speaker>SHURI</speaker> \\nHe has a War Dog tattoo... but we have no record of him. \\nIs this man Wakandan or not? (SPEAKING XHOSA) Tell us what is going on. \\nSpeak. I\\'m standing in your house... serving justice to a man who stole your\\nvibranium and murdered your people. Justice your king couldn\\'t deliver. \\nI don\\'t care that you brought Klaue. Only reason I don\\'t kill you where \\nyou stand is because I know who you are. Now, what do you want? I want \\nthe throne. (LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA) My goodness. (TRIBES\\' ELDERS LAUGHING)\\nY\\'all sittin\\' up here comfortable. Must feel good. It\\'s about two billion\\npeople all over the world that looks like us. But their lives are a lot harder.\\nWakanda has the tools to liberate \\'em all. And what tools are those? \\nVibranium. Your weapons. Our weapons will not be used to wage war on\\nthe world. It is not our way to be judge, jury and executioner... \\nfor people who are not our own. Not your own? But didn\\'t life start\\nright here on this continent? So ain\\'t all people your people? \\nI am not king of all people. I am king of Wakanda. And it is my\\nresponsibility to make sure our people are safe... and that vibranium\\ndoes not fall into the hands of a person like you. \\n\\n<speaker>KILLMONGER</speaker> \\nMmm... \\n\\n<speaker>RAMONDA</speaker> \\nSon. We have entertained this charlatan for too long. \\nReject his request. Oh, I ain\\'t requesting nothing. - Ask who I am. -\\nYou\\'re Erik Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed\\nKillmonger. That\\'s who you are. That\\'s not my name, Princess. Ask me, \\nKing. No. Ask me. Take him away. (IN XHOSA) Who are you? I am N\\'Jadaka,\\nson of Prince N\\'Jobu. Son of N\\'Jobu? with Panther claws in his chest! \\nYou ain\\'t the son of a king. You a son of a murderer.

T\\'Challa, what do you know of this? \\nI accept your challenge. \\n\\n<speaker>SHURI</speaker> \\nHe\\'ll never beat T\\'Challa.

(UPBEAT DRUMMING) \\n\\n<speaker>ZURI</speaker> \\nThe king will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away. \\n(LABORED BREATHING) Where is Agent Ross?

I trained, I lied, I killed... just to get here. \\nI killed in America, Afghanistan... Iraq. I took life from my own \\nbrothers and sisters right here on this continent. And all this death... \\njust so I could kill you. Let the challenge begin. - (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING) \\n- (GRUNTING) Yield! (GROANS) (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTS) (GROANS) Snap out of it,\\nT\\'Challa!

(RAMONDA CRYING)\\nThe Queen Mother and Shuri, they are safe? - Yes. - (SIGHS) (IN XHOSA)\\nThank you. to them immediately. (IN XHOSA) I cannot. Though my heart is\\nwith you. We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only\\nhours ago. He is of royal blood. - He killed T\\'Challa! - In ritual combat.\\nDoes that really matter? You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has. \\nHelp me overthrow him before he becomes too strong. Overthrow? Nakia!\\nI\\'m not a spy who can come and go as they so choose! I am loyal to that\\nthrone, no matter who sits upon it. What are you loyal to? I loved him.\\nI loved my country, too. Then you serve your country. No. I save my country.\\nWhat\\'s wrong?

(SOBBING QUIETLY) \\n\\n<speaker>N\\'JOBU</speaker> \\nWhat did I tell you about going into my things? Hmm? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) \\nWhat did you find? Your home. I gave you a key hoping that you might see\\nit someday. Yes. The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world. \\nBut I fear you still may not be welcome. Why? They will say you are lost.\\nBut I\\'m right here. (SIGHS HEAVILY) No tears for me? Everybody dies. \\nIt\\'s just life around here. Well, look at what I have done. I should\\'ve\\ntaken you back long ago. Instead, we are both abandoned here. \\nWell, maybe your home is the one that\\'s lost. That\\'s why they can\\'t find us.\\n(GASPING) Breathe! Breathe, My King, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.\\nThe Heart-Shaped Herb did that? This all of it? Yes. So when it comes \\ntime for another king, we will be ready. Another king? Yeah, go ahead \\nand burn all that. My King, we cannot do that. It is our tradition... \\n(CHOKING) When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit. (YELPS) \\n(BOTH GASP) Burn it all! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) You know, where I\\'m from... \\nwhen black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower... \\nor the resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? \\nYeah, all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth.\\nAlready in place. I know how colonizers think. So we\\'re gonna use their own\\nstrategy against \\'em. We\\'re gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs.\\nThey\\'ll arm oppressed people all over the world... so they can finally rise\\nup and kill those in power. And their children. And anyone else who takes\\ntheir side. It\\'s time they know the truth about us! We\\'re warriors! \\nThe world\\'s gonna start over, and this time, we\\'re on top. The sun will\\nnever set on the Wakandan empire. \\n\\n<speaker>KOYE</speaker> \\nWakanda has survived for so long... by fighting when only absolutely necessary.\\nWakanda survived in the past this way, yes. But the world is changing, General.\\nElders, it is getting smaller. The outside world is catching up... and soon \\nit will be the conquerors or the conquered. I\\'d rather be the former. \\nYou heard your orders. Let\\'s get to it. \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nSo where are we going again? \\n\\n<speaker>NAKIA</speaker> \\nWe\\'re taking the Heart-Shaped Herb to Jabariland. Heart-Shaped Herb? \\nWhat is that? It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities. \\nIt\\'s what made T\\'Challa so strong. Nakia. I don\\'t like this. \\nThe Herb belongs to us. We may be creating a bigger monster with M\\'Baku.\\nNakia, you should take it yourself. I am a spy with no army. \\nI wouldn\\'t stand a chance. (SIGHS) We\\'ll go. Oh, boy. (SHUSHES) \\n(MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING) \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nOh, shit. Look down. Stay calm. Shuri. Look down. My son... \\nwas murdered in ritual combat. - Were the odds fair? - Yes, but...\\nSo it was less a murder than a defeat. - Do not rub our noses in it! \\n- Silence! I make the pronouncements here, girl. Look, uh, Your Highness, \\nthe new king is a U.S... (GRUNTS) - The new king... - (MEN GRUNTING) \\n\\n<speaker>M\\'BAKU</speaker> \\nYou cannot talk! One more word, and I will feed you to my children. \\nI\\'m kidding. We are vegetarians. (LAUGHING) \\n\\n<speaker>NAKIA</speaker> \\nGreat Gorilla M\\'Baku... this is why we are here. To offer this to you. \\nAn outsider sits on our throne. Only you can help us stop him. Come with me.\\n- (GASPS) - Impossible! (RAMONDA GASPING) Is he breathing? He\\'s in a coma. \\nBarely clinging to life. One of our fishermen found him at the edge of the \\nriver border. He brought him to me. Why do you have him in the snow? \\nIt is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors. \\nWe need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there. Take him. He\\'ll be\\ndead in seconds. Nakia, the Herb. I call upon the ancestors. I call\\nupon Bast. I am here with my son, T\\'Challa. Heal him. We must bury him.\\nCover him. Cover him! Okay. (IN XHOSA) Praise the ancestors. Praise \\nthe ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Wake up, T\\'Challa. \\nWake up. (T\\'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA) My son. for you to come home... \\nand be reunited with me. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Why? bring the boy home? \\nWhy, Baba? He... He was the truth I chose to omit. You were wrong to\\nabandon him. I chose my people. I chose Wakanda. Our future depended... \\nYou were wrong! All of you were wrong! To turn your backs on the rest of\\nthe world! We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right!\\nNo more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the\\nthrone. He is a monster of our own making. I must take the mantle back. \\nI must! I must right these wrongs. - (T\\'CHALLA GASPS) - (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)\\n(SHIVERING) Do you have a blanket? \\n\\n<speaker>NAKIA</speaker> \\nKillmonger has the full support of our military. And he burned the garden\\nof the Heart-Shaped Herb. \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nOf course he did. That\\'s what he was trained to do. His unit used to \\nwork with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries. They would always\\nstrike at transitions of power... like an election year, or the death \\nof a monarch. You get control of government, the military... - \\nOur resources. - \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nRight. The Great Mound. Our vibranium, all of my designs. \\nHe will send our weapons all over the world. You must get \\nthem out of Wakanda safely. - What? - What about you? \\nThe challenge will have to continue. T\\'Challa, we will \\nnot leave Wakanda. It is my duty to keep you safe. If he gets control \\nof our technology, nowhere will be safe. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) The Black Panther\\nlives. And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda... I will be right there\\nbeside him. As will I. \\n\\n<speaker>ROSS</speaker> \\nI\\'m in, too. What? You\\'re gonna need all the help you can get.\\n(M\\'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY) Are you done? (STAMMERS) Are you done? \\nCould you give me and Lord M\\'Baku a moment? (SIGHS) Thank you.\\nI owed you a great debt. A life for a life. Consider it paid. \\nPlease allow my mother to stay here. No harm will come to her.\\nI give you my word. You know, I could use an army as well. \\nI bet you could. (LAUGHS) But no. I will give no Jabari lives towards \\nyour cause. It is our cause. - It is for all of us. - Oh, us? Us? \\nYou are the first king to come here in centuries... and now you speak of \"us\"?\\nI cannot speak for past kings. But an enemy sits on the throne right now.\\nWe both know the power of vibranium. If Killmonger gains control of it,\\nwho do you think he will come for next? We will not help you. (SIGHS) \\n(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) \\n\\n<speaker>W\\'KABI</speaker> \\nEverything is on schedule. Have the spies been alerted? Yes. \\nSome resistance to our new mission. But the War Dogs in London,\\nNew York and Hong Kong are standing by. We\\'ll strike there first. \\nThe others\\'ll come around. Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon, \\npowerful enough to stop a tank... untraceable by metal detectors. \\nAnd we got thousands of them. The world\\'s gonna find out exactly \\nwho we are. (EXPLOSION) He lives. N\\'Jadaka! Wassup? I never yielded! \\nAnd as you can see, I am not dead! All that challenge shit is over with!\\nI\\'m the king now! Get those planes in the air!
